				<dl>
					<dt>Could you give a brief description of yourself?</dt>
					<dd>I'm a second-year student at Conestoga College in the Computer Programmer/Analyst co-op program, scheduled to graduate in April 2018. I'm passionate about programming and have enjoyed it since my first exposure to it in high school. I have always enjoyed learning and am a dedicated student, maintaining a 4.0 GPA through my first 4 semesters until now.</dd>
					<dt>What do you do in your spare time away from school?</dt>
					<dd>In my spare time I enjoy looking at various technologies taught at school and expanding them a bit more to fit more situations and problems. Additionally, I greatly enjoy choral singing and have been part of several choral groups within the past few years, including a tour to the British Isles.</dd>
					<dt>What are your plans for the coming year away from school?</dt>
					<dd>I am planning on working as a co-op student at a Waterloo company once this semester is over, and will be working there for at least 8 months in the role of a software/web developer.</dd>
					<dt>What do you plan to do on the side during this time?</dt>
					<dd>My goal is to design and complete a non-trivial mobile app (using a framework of some kind) and use PhoneGap (or similar) to deploy it to an app store. I also hope to gain experience and become more comfortable with languages and platforms such as PHP, JavaScript, Linux, etc.</dd>
					<dt>Between the fields of web, software, mobile, and game development, what interests you the most?</dt>
					<dd>At this point, probably web development, as I feel that it has both the greatest exposure as well as some of the most varying learning topics. There's always new ideas to explore and ways to adapt existing ones.</dd>
					<dt>Are you interested in the other mentioned fields?</dt>
					<dd>Definitely. I'm also rather curious about mobile development, as it's something I've never really done. I'm looking forward to spending some time experimenting with it during the coming months, but it will probably stay as a side-focus for now. That being said, I would like to spend some time learning dedicated Android development before heading back for my final year, in order to know a fair bit about it already.</dd>
					<dt>You also mentioned becoming more comfortable with various technologies, could you talk a bit more about that?</dt>
					<dd>I'm hoping to spend a significant amount of time acquanting myself with more than just the basics of several languages/platforms, such as learning more advanced JavaScript and jQuery, as well as looking at using Linux as my web development OS.</dd>
					<dt>Are there any other languages that you want to look at?</dt>
					<dd>Absolutely! The first ones that I would like to learn the basics of are Ruby, Python, and Git, as these seem to be still quite common but were unfortunately not taught in my program.</dd>
					<dt>Looking further down the road, where do you see yourself in two years?</dt>
					<dd>Graduated from the Computer Programmer/Analyst program at Conestoga College, and employed at a reputable organization where I can continue to expand my programming knowledge while helping to analyze and solve business problems effectively within a development team.</dd>
