# UnaviaMedia Website

This repository is the home for the source code of my portfolio website, _unaviamedia.ca_. It is a personal project that I will keep iterating upon as I learn new skills and tricks as a web developer. Currently it is on the fourth iteration; each iteration progressively becoming *more* modern and responsive.

For the current display of updates, please view the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
